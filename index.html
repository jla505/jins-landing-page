                    <p>The Golden Retriever is a sturdy, muscular dog of medium size, famous for the dense, lustrous coat of gold 
                        that gives the breed its name. The broad head, with its friendly and intelligent eyes, short ears, and straight 
                        muzzle, is a breed hallmark.

                <p>“Golden retrievers are not bred to be guard dogs, and considering the size of their hearts and their irrepressible 
                    joy and life, they are less likely to bite than to bark, less likely to bark than to lick a hand in greeting. In 
                    spite of their size, they think they are lap dogs, and in spite of being dogs, they think they’re also human, and 
                    nearly every human they meet is judged to have the potential to be a boon companion who might at any moment, cry, 
                    “Let’s go!” and lead them on a great adventure.”
